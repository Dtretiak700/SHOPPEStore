                <p className={`customer-info_${theme}`}>I recently purchased a pair of golden earrings, and I couldn't be happier with them. The craftsmanship is exquisite, and the gold has a beautiful shine that adds a touch of elegance to any outfit. They're incredibly versatileâ€”I've worn them both casually and for special occasions, and they always get compliments. The earrings are also very comfortable, even for extended wear. Overall, these golden earrings are a fantastic addition to my jewelry collection, combining timeless beauty with practical durability. Highly recommend!</p>
